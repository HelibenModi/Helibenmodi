## Featured Projects
# AI-Based Wildfire Risk Prediction System (Ongoing)
An intelligent predictive analytics system that analyzes environmental and meteorological data to estimate wildfire risk using machine learning models.

# Key Features:
Data preprocessing and missing value handling
Feature engineering from weather and environmental datasets
Wildfire risk prediction using ML models
Performance comparison using evaluation metrics
Visualization of prediction results

# CineCloud — Movie AI Review System
An intelligent movie search web application that integrates the OMDB API and YouTube API to provide dynamic movie information, trailers, and AI-generated reviews. Users can rate movies, view average ratings, and get instant AI insights without requiring stored movie data. Built using a structured PHP MVC architecture with a focus on scalability and clean UI.

# Key Features:
Live movie search using OMDB API
AI-generated movie reviews
User rating system with average calculation
Automatic trailer fetching via YouTube API
PHP MVC architecture with Bootstrap styling

# Reminder CRUD System
A secure, user-specific reminder management system that allows authenticated users to create, view, update, and delete personal notes. Designed using the MVC pattern with strong session handling and clean Bootstrap UI for an intuitive user experience.

# Key Features:
User authentication and session protection
Create, edit, and delete reminders
User-specific data isolation
Responsive Bootstrap interface
Clean MVC structure

# Loan Default Risk Prediction System
A machine learning project that analyzes financial and demographic data to predict the likelihood of loan default. The system performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training to support risk-based decision making for financial institutions.

# Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Predictive modeling for default risk
Model performance evaluation
Insights for financial risk assessment
